## Snapshots

- to create snapshots, type `:PackerSnapshot <name of snap>`
- `name of snap` can be an absolute path
- for the sake of simplicity and git tracking, snapshots are saved under `./packer_snaps`, where `.` is the current directory (`~/.config/nvim/`)
- check the [docs](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#custom-initialization) to see how to config packer to use a custon snap directory
